# Hi there, I'm David üëã
Welcome to my GitHub! üöÄ

## About Me

I'm an AI expert, forever student, and BMW AI alum dedicated to the pursuit of freedom and value through technology. I'm currently building the [Drifft newsletter](https://drifft.beehiiv.com) and exploring solutions to challenging problems in commodities and geospatial intelligence. I work with startups and business leaders to prototype AI at a reasonable cost on a short-term basis (1-3 months). Contact me if you'd like to explore solutions but aren't ready to commit serious capital.

## Code Sections

- **Artificial Intelligence**: I specialize in accelerating AI projects that involve computer vision, natural language processing, and traditional programming. Browse my AI notebooks where I demonstrate some of these technologies.
- **Commodities**: I'm interested in speeding the transition to electric energy with capital and technology. I am testing softwares and approaches to help mining professionals and investors achieve results faster with less mistakes.
- **Space & Exploration**: Passionate about exploring our world? Me too! I'm finding ways satellites and drones can be used to guide automated decisions for good and for profit.
- **LLMs & Robotics**: I'm fascinated by multimodal transformers and their ability to accelearte robot programming. I'm researching ways to utilize this architecture on an industrial scale.
- **Finance**: I provide insights into tech and news for financial independence‚Äìtypically open data and software, quantum, cyber security, and Web3.
- **Hobbies**: I share my adventures in photography, photoshop art, and the outdoors.
